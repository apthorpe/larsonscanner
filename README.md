Larson Scanner Code
==========

Software for the [Larson Scanner](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/tinykitlist/152-scanner)
kit from Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories.


The Larson scanner is named after Glen A. Larson, the man responsible for producing 
both the original Battlestar Galactica and Knight Rider television shows.


The Larson Scanner is an open source hardware+software project designed and released by Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories.
based in the "ix" circuit board with an ATtiny2313 microcontroller and nine LEDs. This project site is set up for sharing code-- primarily AVR-GCC for the '2313 --for that kit.
