The Larson scanner is named after Glen A. Larson, the man responsible for producing both the original Battlestar Galactica and Knight Rider television shows.

The Larson Scanner kit from Evil Mad Science is an open source hardware + software project, based in the "ix" circuit board with an ATtiny2313 microcontroller and nine LEDs.    This project site is set up for sharing code-- primarily AVR-GCC for the '2313 --for that kit.

Larson Scanner documentation is hosted at the Evil Mad Science Wiki:
